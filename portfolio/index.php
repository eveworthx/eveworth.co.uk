  				<p class="portfolio_description"> Here I created an interactive Easter themed image, using HTML, CSS and jQuery. The user can click on each individual egg to unwrap them and reveal the contents. I aim to create different variations of this image focusing on different seasons/holidays when I have more time.</p>

  				<p class="portfolio_description"> Here I worked on a project for a small business, creating a website for a childminder. The website was created using WordPress. I worked on modifications to the CSS, creating the logo/icons and editing content for the different sections. I have enjoyed working on this project and feel that it gave me a great opportunity to develop my skills using WordPress, I feel that as a result of this I have a better knowledge on using WordPress themes etc.</p>
