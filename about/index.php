					<h2>Work Experience</h2>

				<p class="work_experience"> I have recently been working as an intern at <strong>Ascensor</strong>, where my main focus has been <strong>design</strong> and <strong>front end development</strong>. This experience has proven to be invaluable, as I have greatly improved both my <strong>design</strong> and <strong>technical</strong> skills during my time spent with the company. </p>
